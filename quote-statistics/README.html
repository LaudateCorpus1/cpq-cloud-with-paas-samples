The application is invoked from the CPQ Cloud opportunity screen, and customer information is passed to it. The application will then consume data via the CPQ Cloud REST APIs to generate information (in this case, provide the average net total across quotes for this customer) which is then displayed on the CPQ opportunity screen. Sales users may use this information to make adjustments to maximize conversion potential. Although a simple statistic is calculated, this application can be extended.</p><h2 id="TechnicalOverview">Technical Overview</h2><p>The application's main UI is a JSP page, which displays the relevant statistic as text. This page is invoked by having the application URL set as the source of an IFrame on the opportunity screen, via a CPQ Cloud commerce HTML attribute. 
When the application loads, a 3-legged OAuth flow is initiated by the application with CPQ Cloud OAuth Provider, resulting in generating an access token that allows the application to call the Transaction REST API for CPQ Cloud on the same instance.</p><p>Initially, when the opportunity page loads, the application receives the business logic parameters necessary as input to calculate the statistics. These paraemters are: customer name, CPQ server URI, commerce resource name, current quote id. However, the application would not have the access token that allows it to call CPQ Cloud REST API to fetch data in order to calculate these statistics.
For the purpose of negotiating an access token, the JCS - SaaS Extension sample also has code that performs the 3-legged OAuth flow. The application kicks off the 3-legged flow (specfically, the "authorization code grant" flow) to negotiate an access token with the CPQ Cloud Authorization server. This flow takes place via the front-channel (browser redirects); a cookie is used in the background to remember the original application resource url requested. This flow, if successful, binds the token to the original URL as a query&nbsp; parameter, and finally redirects to the original application URL. 
The JCS - SaaS Extension application resource requested can then use the access token as a Bearer token to invoke the CPQ Cloud Transaction API to collect the information it needs and displays it on the JSP page.</p><p>For being able to negotiate an access token, an OAuth client is registered with the CPQ Cloud OAuth server via its client endpoint. The client key, id, and secret obtained this way are made available to this JCS - SaaS Extension application code. During the runtime 3-legged flow, the OAuth redirect endpoint on the JCS - SaaS Extension receives the authorization code generated by the CPQ OAuth server and negotiates the access token, redirecting to the original application URI with the the access token in the final step.</p><p>Note:
This sample demonstrates how to secure authorization to the embedded JCS-SaaS Extension web application using the SSO session. For this to work, the IDP that your CPQ instance uses for SSO should be already federated with Oracle PaaS. Detail on this is not in the scope of the sample and the SSO aspects of your environment are expected to be pre-determined.</p><h2 id="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>All sample code is provided by Oracle for illustrative purposes only.

In the Import popup select "Web Source" and click OK to bring up Web Source popup. Click "Copy From:" browse button, navigate to cloned git repository in your working directory and select public_html folder. Click OK to close the "Web Source" popup.</li></ul></li><li>Setup the source to compile<ul><li>Open the Import Popup again like in step 2 and select Java Source. Select the src folder from the cloned repository by clicking on browse button of "Copy From:" option. Click OK.</li></ul></li><li>Setup dependencies required to compile and package<ul><li>Right-click on the header of the project, and select "Project Properties" from the popup menu. In the Project Properties dialog box, select "Libraries and Classpath" in the left pane. This will reveal a list of classpath entries. For a Web project JSP Runtime should already be available, if not, click "Add Library..." and add it from the list. Next Click on the "Add JAR/Directory...", to add the dependency libraries (Users are required to download dependency libraries from external sources. They are not packaged with the sample apps. Please refer the table below for list of libraries). Click OK to close the project properties dialog box and then click Save.</li></ul></li><li>Before this step, you will need to follow step 3 through 5 of the above section that explains the general install scenario. Then, build the project and ensure there are no errors.</li><li>Go the project properties again. Select "Deployment" section in the left pane. Delete the default war under "Deployment Profiles:" if any. Click on "New...". Select WAR File from "Archiver Type:". Give a meaningful name and click OK to navigate to "Edit WAR Deployment Profile Properties". In the right pane give the suitable location of war file and leave the remaining as they are. In the left pane select "Library Dependencies". Right pane shows all the libraries that were added in point 4. Leave JSP Runtime selected and select the remaining as given in table below. Delesect the others. Click OK to close the dialog boxes and click save to save the changes.<ul><li>If you do not see a WAR option in the Archive Type, you are probably looking at Application Properties, instead of Project Properties as suggested by the step.</li></ul></li><li>Right click the project and select "Deploy" &gt; "warfile".
