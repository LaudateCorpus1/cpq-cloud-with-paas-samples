Out of the box, CPQ supports this functionality only when using CSV files. For example, with this utility, a sales user can get a new quote after uploading an Excel file containing a list of options/SKUs that a customer bought. Another use case is when a sales user uploads an Excel file with new corporate rates for a set of products and would like to apply the new pricing to a quote.</p><h2 id="TechnicalOverview">Technical Overview</h2><p>The Excel to CSV Converter web service is deployed to JCS - SaaS Extension. The service exposes a REST endpoint that takes an “.xlsx” file as input in JSON format and responds with the equivalent .csv data in JSON format. The CPQ application is configured by an admin user to call this endpoint within the appropriate workflow, so that the Excel file uploaded by the sales user gets transformed and used as expected by the use case. The web service endpoint is protected using OAuth 2.0. The CPQ web application uses a confidential client to obtain an access token to the JCS - SaaS Extension resource, and using this token, it gains access to the service. This sample demonstrates the setup required to protect web services with OAuth 2.0 in JCS - SaaS Extension, and to show the setup required to access the service using a confidential client.</p><h2 id="Disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p>All sample code is provided by Oracle for illustrative purposes only.

In the Import popup select "Web Source" and click ok to bring up Web Source popup. Click "Copy From:" browse button, navigate to cloned git repository in your working directory and select public_html folder. Click OK to close the "Web Source" popup.</li><li>Open the Import Popup again like in step 2 and select Java Source. Select the src folder from the cloned repository by clicking on browse button of "Copy From:" option. Click OK.</li><li>Right-click on the header of the project, and select "Project Properties" from the popup menu. In the Project Properties dialog box, select "Libraries and Classpath" in the left pane. This will reveal a list of classpath entries. For a Web project "JSP Runtime" should already be available, if not, click "Add Library..." and add it from the list of available libraries under extension, also select "Web Service Data Control" and "JUnit 4 Runtime" and click OK. If "Junit 4 Runtime" library is not available then follow instructions to install <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/articles/adf/part5-083468.html">JUnit extension to Jdev</a> and repeat the step to add library. Next Click on the "Add JAR/Directory...", to add the dependency libraries(Users are required to download dependency libraries from external sources. They are not packaged with the sample apps. Please refer the table below for list of libraries) Click OK to close the project properties dialog box and then click Save.<ul><li>Refer to the Dependencies topic below to understand the dependencies for compile-time and runtime.</li></ul></li><li>Build the project and ensure there are no errors.</li><li>Go to the project properties again. Select "Deployment" in the left pane. Delete the default war under "Deployment Profiles:" if any. Click on "New...". Select WAR File from "Archiver Type:". Give a meaningful name and click OK to navigate to "Edit WAR Deployment Profile Properties".In the right pane give the suitable location of war file and leave the remaining as they are. In the left pane select "Library Dependencies". Right pane shows all the libraries that were added in point 4. Leave JSP Runtime selected and select the remaining as given in table below. Delesect the others. Click OK to close the dialog boxes and click save to save the changes.<ul><li>If you do not see a WAR option in the Archive Type, you are probably looking at Application Properties, instead of Project Properties as suggested by the step.</li></ul></li><li>Right click the project and select "Deploy" &gt; "warfile". In the popup, select "Deploy to WAR", click Next and Finish to generate a war file.</li><li>Note that JDeveloper may inject a &lt;context-root&gt; element in weblogic.xml that is already provided in the sample.

Then, fill in the essential details in appropriate placeholders within the script.<ul><li>{JCS-SX-OAuth-token-endpoint}  - This information can be obtained from the interface you used to register the OAuth client during the User and Roles setup in this README.</li><li>{JCS-SX-OAuth-Resource} - This is the URI of the OAuth Resoure you registered during the User and Roles setup in this README</li><li>{JCS-SX-baseuri} - This is the base URI of the JCS-SaaS Extension application</li><li>{application-name} - the name you gave to your application, when you deployed it on JCS - SaaS Extension. In technical terms, this is actually the context-root of the web application. Since this sample does not have a &lt;context-root&gt; element in the weblogic.xml, the name you give your application on the JCS-SX console will become the context-root and hence should be used here. However, if you chose to provide your own web-application-context-root in another way, use that context-root value here to ensure that your application is used by this BML.</li><li>{CPQ-base-uri} - the base URI of your CPQ instance</li><li>Remember to remove the curly brackets "{", "}" when you replace the placeholders with real values.</li></ul></li><li>Save and Close</li></ol></li><li>In the Destination tab, select "Define Destination Rule" and click on the Define Function button.<ol><li>For inputs, select <strong>_transaction</strong><strong>_document</strong><strong>_link</strong></li><li>On the script screen, paste the script as provided in <strong>bml_destination</strong> and "Save and Close".</li></ol></li><li>Finally, commit these changes by clicking "Update" on the action administration screen.</li></ul></li><li>Ultimately, all these changes need to be deployed to be actually made "live" to the end user. To achieve this, deploy the commerce process and ensure that the deploy is successful.</li></ol><h2 id="RunningtheSample">Running the Sample</h2><p>To run the sample:</p><ol><li>Launch the CPQ Cloud application in your browser.</li><li>If you are not already authenticated, you will be prompted to login. Login as a sales agent user type.<ul><li><strong>Note</strong>: the permissions available to a Sales Agent user type for your CPQ setup are very cusomizable. If you find that the sales agent user type does not have permission to Create/Save a transaction, use a full access user instead, and use the home page navigation to follow through the next steps. The behavior with respect to sample app, will be similar.</li></ul></li><li>Once you are logged in, you will see a navigation bar that will allow you to go to the transaction manager of the process you set up earlier. Click it, and you'll see the list of quotes available. A "New Transaction" button should be available too. Either select an existing quote OR create a new transaction (quote) and you'll be redirected to the transaction layout.</li><li>In this layout, find the panel you set up earlier. Using the browse button for <strong>attr_FileAttachment</strong> ,  upload a .xlsx file with 2 columns and no headers.  The first column should be part numbers, the second column should be quantity.  After uploading the file, click "Save" on the transaction . The file should now appear in the layout as attached.<ul><li>To find valid part numbers, you should use the "Parts Search" that appears on your home screen when you logged in.</li></ul></li></ol><ol><li>To execute the action, click on the <strong>action_AddLineItems</strong> button  (probably labelled "Add parts from file").  The quote will refresh, and the <strong>attr_StatusText</strong> will show what the action achieved. If it worked correctly, this action would have added the parts from the file as line items to this quote. The line items will be visible in the Line Item Grid in the transaction layout.</li></ol><h2 id="AdditionalInformation">Additional Information</h2><h3 id="Customizingsamplescriptstoworkwithadifferentcommerceresource">Customizing sample scripts to work with a different commerce resource</h3><p>If the REST transaction resource "commerceDocumentsOraclecpqoTransaction" is not available on your CPQ Cloud instance, you will need to modify some BML scripts in the sample, while following the installation steps for CPQ Cloud, as discussed below:</p><ul><li>Locate the name of the REST transaction resource you want to use.
