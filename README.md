The readme provided with each sample provides a functional and technical overview and summarizes the primary and secondary patterns illustrated in the code and documentation. Instructions are provided to install, configure, and uninstall.

Documentation that supports developers in the process of building applications using similar patterns is found on the related Solutions page in Oracle Cloud Developer Portal (http://cloud.oracle.com/developer/solutions). A link to the associated page is found at the bottom of each readme.
